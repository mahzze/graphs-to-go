# Graphs to Go
The idea behind the project is to create graphs with golang from scratch. But what exactly is a graph?
In pure mathematics graphs are -simplifying to a faulty degree- objects composed by two sets, those being the vertex and edges sets (also referred to as nodes and connections). 
In applied mathematics and especially so in computer science, `graphs` is often used as an umbrella term that includes diagraphs, pseudographs, multigraphs and other graph-like data structures with many characteristics foreign to graphs from pure mathematics.
This project is an attempt to create graphs in different ways, in order to create different kinds of graphs, such as:
- mathematical graphs.
- basic non-directional unweighted graphs with methods to add and remove vertices and edges.
- directional weighted graphs with methods to add and remove vertices and edges + other methods such as shortest path finding algorithms.
The planned techniques to create these graphs include:
- adjacency list
- adjacency matrix
- maybe a crazy structure

I'll be adding things to the project as I study graph theory and it's applications.
